What is photosynthesis?,Photosynthesis converts sunlight into chemical energy in plants.,Plants use chlorophyll in their leaves to capture light.
Explain gravity.,Gravity is a force that attracts objects with mass toward each other.,Sir Isaac Newton described gravity in his Principia.
What causes rain?,Rain forms when water vapor condenses in clouds and falls as droplets.,The water cycle involves evaporation and condensation.
Define entropy.,Entropy is a measure of disorder in a thermodynamic system.,The second law of thermodynamics relates to entropy.
What is DNA?,DNA is a molecule that carries genetic instructions for living organisms.,DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.
Explain machine learning.,Machine learning enables computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming.,ML is a subset of artificial intelligence.
What is the speed of light?,Light travels at approximately 299792458 meters per second in a vacuum.,Einstein's theory of relativity relates to light speed.
Define an algorithm.,An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a computation.,Algorithms are fundamental to computer science.
What is inflation?,Inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services rise over time.,Central banks monitor inflation rates closely.
Explain the water cycle.,The water cycle describes how water evaporates from surfaces and returns as precipitation.,It includes evaporation condensation and collection stages.
What is a black hole?,A black hole is a region of spacetime with gravity so strong that nothing can escape it.,Black holes form when massive stars collapse.
